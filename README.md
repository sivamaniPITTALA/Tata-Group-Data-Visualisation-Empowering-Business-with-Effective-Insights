## Data Cleanup

Before performing any analysis, the data was cleaned to ensure accuracy. The following steps were taken:

1. Removed any records where the quantity was less than 1 unit.
2. Excluded records with a unit price below $0.

These checks were implemented using conditional formulas and data transformation methods to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.

## Analysis and Visualizations
